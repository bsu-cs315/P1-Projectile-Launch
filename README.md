# Project 1 Iteration 2: Graphics and Sound

By Curtis Clemmons.

## How To Play
Try and knock the target into the groove!
In order to change the strength in which the alien is launched use the up and down arrow keys.
The up arrow key will increase the strength by 25 and the down arrow key will decrease the
strength by 25. The default strength is set at 500. The strength is indicated by the length of the arrow.
In order to change the direction in which you fire the alien use the left and right arrow keys. The angle in which the alien will launch is indicated by the direction the line is pointing. Press space to launch the alien.

## Project Report
Iteration 1 Reflection: 
This iteration was fairly difficult, there were a few areas that I struggled to
figure out. In the end I wasn't able to get figure out how to display the angle in which 
the projectile would be launched on my own. I was able to figure it out following along with Doctor G's tutorial. As of now this iteration showed me that I need to mess around with the godot engine and learn more about and probably allot or more time to work on the iteration.

Iteration 2 Reflection: 
Overall, this iteration was pretty straight-forward. Implementing the sound and HUD was really simple. As far as the multiple projectiles, that was a little more difficult. I had to figure out a way to instantiate the projectile without just making it a child node of the Level scene. Once getting all the nitty gritty details figured out it was pretty simple to implement.
